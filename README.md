### I am a Cloud Technical Solutions Engineer at Google, but I have worked as Data Engineer/Machine Learning Specialist for different industries such as steel, automotive, consultancy, marketing and tech. I loved working on data-driven solutions and implemented them on the cloud, particularly GCP, and also AWS.
### I had worked as well as Full Stack particularly with Ruby on Rails and intermediate level with Flask. On another side, I am an Android Enthusiast, and when I had the chance, I like to combine ML with Android with Kotlin.
