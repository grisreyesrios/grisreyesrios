### I am a Data Scientist/Machine Learning Specialist who is currently working on designing and developing data and AI solutions for a consultancy company. I loved working on data-driven solutions and implemented them on the cloud, particularly GCP, and I am currently learning AWS.
### I had worked as well as Full Stack particularly with Ruby on Rails and intermediate level with Flask. On another side, I am an Android Enthusiast, and when I had the chance, I like to combine ML with Android with Kotlin.
